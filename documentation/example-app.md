The Exponea React Native SDK includes an example application you can use as a reference implementation. You can build and run the app, test Engagement features, and compare the code and behavior of your implementation with the expected behavior and code in the example app.

## Prerequisites

You must have the following software installed to be able to build and run the example app:

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [React Native CLI](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli)
- [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) with a virtual or physical device set up to run the app on Android
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) with a virtual or physical device set up to run the app on iOS

> Follow React Native's [Get started](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) guide if you are new to React Native.

## Build and run the example app

1. Clone the [exponea-react-native-sdk](https://github.com/exponea/exponea-react-native-sdk) repository on GitHub:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/exponea/exponea-react-native-sdk.git
   ```
2. Enter the `exponea-react-native-sdk` directory:
   ```shell
   cd exponea-react-native-sdk
   ```
3. Run the following commands to do a clean build of the SDK:
   ```
   ./cleanCache.sh
   yarn
   yarn run build
   rm -rdf node_modules
   ```
4. Enter the `example` directory containing the example app:
   ```shell
   cd example
   ```
5. Run yarn to resolve dependencies:
   ```
   yarn
   ```
5. To run the app on iOS:
   1. Run CocoaPods in the `ios` directory to install dependencies:
      ```shell
      cd ios
      pod install
      cd ..
      ```
   2. Run the app:
      ```shell
      react-native run-ios
      ```
6. To run the app on Android:
   1. Connect a virtual or physical Android device.
   2. Run the app:
      ```shell
      react-native run-android --mode=GmsDebug
      ```
      Alternatively, use `--mode=HmsDebug` for Huawei devices without GooglePlay services but with HMS Core. For React Native version <0.73, use `--variant` instead of `--mode`, see [#2026](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/pull/2026).

> To enable push notifications in the example app, you must also configure the [Apple Push Notification Service integration](https://documentation.bloomreach.com/engagement/docs/ios-sdk-configure-apns) (for iOS) or the [Firebase integration](https://documentation.bloomreach.com/engagement/docs/android-sdk-configure-firebase) or [Huawei integration](https://documentation.bloomreach.com/engagement/docs/android-sdk-configure-huawei) (for Android) in the Exponea web app.

## Navigate the example app

![Example app screens (iOS)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exponea/exponea-react-native-sdk/main/Documentation/images/react-native-ios.png)

When you run the app in the simulator, you'll see the **AuthScreen**. Enter your [project token, API token, and API base URL](https://documentation.bloomreach.com/engagement/docs/mobile-sdks-api-access-management). Then click `Start` to [initialize the SDK](https://documentation.bloomreach.com/engagement/docs/react-native-sdk-setup#initialize-the-sdk).
> [`AuthScreen.tsx`](https://github.com/exponea/exponea-react-native-sdk/blob/main/example/src/screens/AuthScreen.tsx)

The app provides several screens, accessible using the bottom navigation, to test the different SDK features:

- The **Tracking** screen enables you to test tracking of different events and properties, as well as open the app inbox. The `Identify customer` and `Track event` buttons open modals to enter test data.
  > [`TrackingScreen.tsx`](https://github.com/exponea/exponea-react-native-sdk/blob/main/example/src/screens/TrackingScreen.tsx)
  > [`IdentifyCustomerModal.tsx`](https://github.com/exponea/exponea-react-native-sdk/blob/main/example/src/components/IdentifyCustomerModal.tsx)
  > [`TrackEventModal.tsx`](https://github.com/exponea/exponea-react-native-sdk/blob/main/example/src/components/TrackEventModal.tsx)

- The **Fetching** screen enables you to fetch consents, recommendations, and segments.
  > [`FetchingScreen.tsx`](https://github.com/exponea/exponea-react-native-sdk/blob/main/example/src/screens/FetchingScreen.tsx)

- The **Flushing** screen lets you trigger a manual data flush as well as anonymize the customer data. The `Anonymize` button opens a modal to optionally enter new project configuration parameters.
  > [`FlushingScreen.tsx`](https://github.com/exponea/exponea-react-native-sdk/blob/main/example/src/screens/FlushingScreen.tsx)
  > [AnonymizeModal.tsx](https://github.com/exponea/exponea-react-native-sdk/blob/main/example/src/components/AnonymizeModal.tsx)

- The **Config** screen enables you to configure default properties to track with any event. The `Default properties` button opens a modal that lists the current default properties and enables you to enter new ones.
  > [TrackingScreen.tsx](https://github.com/exponea/exponea-react-native-sdk/blob/main/example/src/screens/TrackingScreen.tsx)
  > [DefaultPropertiesModal.tsx](https://github.com/exponea/exponea-react-native-sdk/blob/main/example/src/components/DefaultPropertiesModal.tsx)

- The **In-App Content Blocks** screens displays in-app content blocks. Use placeholder IDs `example_top`, `ph_x_example_iOS`, and `example_list` in your in-app content block settings.
  > [`InAppCbScreen.tsx`](https://github.com/exponea/exponea-react-native-sdk/blob/main/example/src/screens/InAppCbScreen.tsx)

Try out the different features in the app, then find the customer profile in the Engagement web app (under `Data & Assets` > `Customers`) to see the properties and events tracked by the SDK.

Until you use `Identify customer` in the app, the customer is tracked anonymously using a cookie soft ID. You can look up the cookie value in the logs and find the corresponding profile in the Engagement web app.

Once you use `Identify customer` in the app to set the `registered` hard ID (use an email address as value), the customer is identified and can be found in Engagement web app by their email address.

> Refer to [Customer identification](https://documentation.bloomreach.com/engagement/docs/customer-identification) for more information on soft IDs and hard IDs.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues running the example app, the following may help:

- Run `rm -rf node_modules` in the root folder before running `yarn` in the `example` folder.
- If you see errors building for iOS, run `rm -rf Pods`, then `pod install` in the `example/ios` folder.
