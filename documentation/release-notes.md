  * Universal link/App link tracking added. There is some setup required that is described in [documentation](./LINKING.md)
* Bug Fixes
  * Fixed: All user defined data is now forwarded to Javascript when fetching recommendations on iOS
  * **BREAKING CHANGE:**
  The SDK now processes notification open events that start the application on iOS. Before, the app had to running and minimized for the notification to be processed. To respond to notifications that start the application, the SDK needs to run some processing in `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`.
  `ExponeaAppDelegate` now implements this method where it processes the notification and sets notification center delegate. Your `AppDelegate application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` now requires a **call to super** `[super application:application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions];`. Calling `[UNUserNotificationCenter currentNotificationCenter].delegate = self;` is no longer required. See [iOS push notifications documentation](./PUSH_IOS.md) for more details.
