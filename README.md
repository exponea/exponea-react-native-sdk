# React Native Exponea SDK

React Native Exponea SDK allows your application to interact with the [Bloomreach Engagement](https://www.bloomreach.com/) Customer Data & Experience Platform. Engagement empowers B2C marketers to raise conversion rates, improve acquisition ROI, and maximize customer lifetime value.

The SDK is implemented in Typescript as a wrapper around [native Android SDK](https://github.com/exponea/exponea-android-sdk) and [native iOS SDK](https://github.com/exponea/exponea-ios-sdk). It is compatible with React Native 0.77.0 - 0.81.3. Earlier versions may work but have not been tested.

> Bloomreach Engagement was formerly known as Exponea. For backward compatibility, the Exponea name continues to be used in the React Native SDK.

## Getting started

Install the package using npm or yarn:
* `$ yarn add react-native-exponea-sdk`
* `$ npm install react-native-exponea-sdk --save`

### iOS setup

* `$ cd ios`
* `$ pod install`

Minimal supported iOS version for Exponea SDK is 15.1, you may need to change iOS version on the first line of your `ios/Podfile` to `platform :ios, '15.1'`, or higher.

### Android setup

You'll most likely need to enable multidex. Edit `android/app/build.gradle` and add `multiDexEnabled true` to android defaultConfig.
```
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        multiDexEnabled true
    }
```
